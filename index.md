[Dr. Leanne Hirshfield](http://google.com) directs the System Human-Interaction with NIRS and EEG (SHINE) Lab at the University of Colorado Boulder's Institute of Cognitive Science. The SHINE Lab’s research is focused at the intersection of cognitive psychology and machine learning. We explore the use of non-invasive cognitive and physiological measurements to passively predict people’s social-cognitive-affective states in order to better understand, and ultimately improve, human performance and the design of intelligent systems. Hosted at the University of Colorado’s Center for Innovation and Creativity (CINC), the lab contains a myriad of non-invasive cognitive, physiological, and behavioral measurement devices. For cognitive state measurements, this includes a 52-channel functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) device from Hitachi Medical (ETG 4000), an 8-channel ISS Oxyplex fNIRS device, a 4-channel PLUX wireless fNIRS device, and Advanced Brain Monitoring’s b-alert wireless EEG. The lab also contains physiological sensors for measuring electrodermal activity, respiration, and heart-rate variability, which are often used to complement the cognitive fNIRS/EEG data.
